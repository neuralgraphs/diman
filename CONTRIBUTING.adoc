This article provides guidelines on how to contribute to diman.

== What is an Issue?

Contribution to the project is based on GitHub issues. Extensive use of labels categorizes the issues. Some "standard labels" to find issues and begin working are:

* Something isn't working https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/bug[[#d73a4a]#bug#]
* Improvements or additions to documentation https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/documentation[[#0075ca]#documentation#]
* This issue or pull request already exists https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/duplicate[[#cfd3d7]#duplicate#]
* New feature or request https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/enhancement[[#a2eeef]#enhancement#]
* Good for newcomers https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/good%20first%20issue[[#7057ff]#good first issue#]
* Extra attention is needed https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/help%20wanted[[#008672]#help wanted#]
* This doesn't seem right https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/invalid[[#e4e669]#invalid#]
* Further information is requested https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/question[[#d876e3]#question#]
* Improve design/structure without changing behavior https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/refactor[[#ccff00]#refactor#]
* Make the code cleaner and clearer https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/simplify[[#96c8a2]#simplify#]
* This needs a test https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/test[[#ff8c00]#test#]
* This will not be worked on https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/wontfix[[#ffffff]#wontfix#]

=== Proposing a New Issue

If a contributor has discovered a "potential issue" that has not yet been highlighted, follow the steps:

. Create a GitHub issue with all the relevant details; the problem/issue and rationale for why it is a problem/issue and the proposed solution/change.
* *Do not* make a pull request without creating the issue.
. Wait for the created issue to be designated by a label.
. Begin working on the labeled issue -- with some exceptions like https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/wontfix[[#ffffff]#wontfix#], see above list.
* See <<the_contribution_process,the contribution process>>

==== A Note on Proposing New Issues

Before posting https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/labels/question[[#d876e3]#question#] issue please make sure the exact or related question is not already part of the https://github.com/neuralgraphs/diman/discussions[discussions].

== The Contribution Process [[the_contribution_process]]

Steps to contribute are:

. Comment on the labeled issue.
* This avoids conflicts with another contributor who might work on the issue.
. Write the code.
* *All codes must* be <<documentation_guidelines, documented.>>
* *All codes must* implement https://clojure.org/guides/spec[clojure.spec]footnote:[As of the time of writing this manual the diman codes are not yet specified, but they will be specified in the future and regardless of this situation all new contributing codes are expected to have its specification.]
* Wherever appropriate there should be accompanying tests.
. Submit a <<pull_request_guidelines, pull request.>>
. Wait for code review and address any associated issue.

=== Documentation Guidelines [[documentation_guidelines]]

Documentation refers to docstrings within the source code and documentation on functionalities (how to use and rationale for why or how the functionality is needed). The first type of documentation is mandatory for all contributions made to the source code.

Source code documentation are docstrings which may contain markdown syntax.

* For private functions
** One or two sentences describing the purpose of the private function.
* For public functions
** A more detailed description referring to not just the functions input and what it returns but also based on the complexity, how it does it.
* Inside namespace
** List the public functions and how it can be used.
** Provide examples for using the public functions.
** Make generous use of markdown syntax (inside the docstring) to illustrate the examples.

=== Pull Request Guidelines [[pull_request_guidelines]]

. Make a separate branch.
* *Do not* make changes in the default branch.
. Push your code (in your branch).
* https://www.worklytics.co/commit-early-push-often/[Early and often] rule.
. Create a pull request.
.. .
Begin with draft pull request

.. Start the title with *[WIP]* for "work in progress" such that, [WIP] Title goes here
. Describe your pull request.
.. Populate the template making sure the following place holder tags are replaced
* `+#[issue_number]+` by for e.g. `+#12+` which corresponds to the labelled issue that the contributor is working on.
* `+@[author]+` by for e.g. `+@joe+`
* `+[ ]+` by `+[x]+` to mark off checklists
.. Detail your changes -- more detailed the better.
.. Describe the specification and how you tested the changes.
. Review process
.. Request review.
... Remove *[WIP]* from the draft pull request title.
... Change the pull request from draft to regular.
... https://help.github.com/en/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review[Request a review] if a reviewer is not automatically assigned.
.. Incorporate reviewer's feedback.
... For pull request receiving feedback, "Changes requested"
* Address the feedback.
* Do not close the pull request and make a new one.
* Update the pull request by pushing to the same branch.
... Make it clear that you have addressed the changes following the feedback
* .
Make a *re-request review* for the reviewing the changes

.. Wait for the maintainers to either reject, accept, or repeat step-b (Incorporate reviewer's feedback).
